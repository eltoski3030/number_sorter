# Sorting Algorithm Project


          
This project contains a simple and reusable sorting algorithm implemented in JavaScript. It's designed to be easily integrated into any project requiring sorting functionality.

## Description

This sorting algorithm provides a versatile solution for sorting arrays of any data type. Whether you're dealing with numbers, strings, or custom objects, this algorithm efficiently sorts them in ascending order. It employs the bubble sort algorithm, which is a classic and straightforward sorting technique.

## Instructions

1. **Download the Files**: Download the project files from the repository.

2. **Run Locally**: Simply run the project in a local server environment. You can use the extension live server in VS studio code in a `http-server` or Python's built-in HTTP server (`python -m http.server`) to serve the files locally.

3. **Collaboration**: Even thought  I have found different ways to develop this kind of program, still this sorting algorithm can enhance the sorting capabilities of your applications. If you want to share better ways to work this program, I  am very open to suggestions for improvements. I theres to find any bug please report them. Your contributions are always  welcome.
